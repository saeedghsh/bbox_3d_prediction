# 3D Bounding Box Prediction
A deep learning pipeline for 3D bounding box prediction of objects from color image and point cloud data.

ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer: Experimental & Potentially Buggy**  
This project is still a work in progress and may contain bugs or unexpected behavior.

## Usage examples

<details>
<summary>Install dependencies</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

```bash
# Simple visualization of the dataset
python -m utils.visualize_data
```

## Development

<details>
<summary>Code quality checks</summary>

**Linter, formatter and type check**
```bash
$ black . --check
$ isort . --check-only
$ mypy .
$ pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

**Tests and coverage**
```bash
$ pytest --cov=. --cov-report html; firefox htmlcov/index.html
$ coverage report -m # see which lines are missing coverage
```

NOTE: using `xvfb-run` is useful for running pytest when testing GUI stuff, e.g. on a headless remote (i.e. CI in `github/workflows`).
```bash
$ xvfb-run --auto-servernum pytest
```

**Profiling** (if needed)
```bash
python -m cProfile -o profile.out -m entry.script
tuna profile.out
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>TODO</summary>

**Workflow and code quality**:
* [ ] complete test coverage
* [ ] fix the discrepancy between local and remote execution of the `mypy`.
* [ ] speed up github CI workflows
</details>
